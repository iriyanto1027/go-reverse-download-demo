# 🧩 Software Engineer – Home Assignment

## 📘 Scenario

You are designing a system that involves a **cloud-hosted server** and multiple **on-premise clients** (for example, deployed at restaurants).

Each on-premise client resides within a **private local network** and is **not directly accessible** from the public internet.  
Each client maintains a file of approximately **100MB**, located at a specific path on the client machine.

---

## 🎯 Objective

Design and implement a solution where the **server can download this file** from any **connected client** on demand.

---

## 🧠 Requirements

1. **Propose and implement** a solution that allows the server to download this file from any connected client.
2. The server should be able to **trigger the download** through either:
   - an **API call**, or  
   - a **CLI command**.
3. Provide **code that demonstrates** how the server can initiate and complete this download efficiently.

---

## 🧩 Deliverables

You must submit:

- ✅ **Code** for both the **server** and the **client(s)** that implement the download process.  
  (Submit as a **GitHub repository** or a **.zip file**)
- ✅ A **README.md** file explaining how to run the code.

---

## 💡 Notes

- The architecture must account for **network restrictions** (clients behind NAT / private LAN).  
- You are encouraged to use any **modern language or framework** you’re comfortable with.  
- The solution should demonstrate **efficiency, reliability, and clear communication** between server and clients.
